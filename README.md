## Browser

Don't use Firefox, it does not work well with reloading. No idea why. Hopefully it doesn't impact production. Development works fine in Google Chrome.

## Translations

Translations work within this app. It uses [isaachinman/next-i18next](https://github.com/isaachinman/next-i18next). It has two down sides. It does not do translations in (dynamic) routes and it does not translate error pages. This last issue is because Next.js does not support that.
